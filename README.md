# 💡 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in **Java**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, and **pandas**.

All solution files are kept directly in the root of the repository. Each file is named after the problem it solves, often including the problem number and a descriptive title.
